# Tree Traversal Iterators
### By: Emily Trenka

## Project Description
My objective was to implement tree traversals using iterators.
To accomplish this, I had to implement a tree abstract data type, along with its accompanying node and methods for insertion, etc.

Following this, I implemented three basic tree traversals (pre, post, and in order) and exposed them via iterators. These iterators can then be used to progress forward or backward through the desired iteration.

After completing this project, I have a much deeper understanding of trees than before, and their traversals. More importantly, I now understand iterators too!
